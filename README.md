## What is Process Mining (PM) ? <br>
* process of extracting valuable information from event logs/databases that are generated by processes.*
 * process discovery: analysing event data to see how a process actually looks like
 * conformance checking: comparing mined process to the reference model (=the process how it should be)
 * prediction: predicting e.g the state or point of time a future event has/occurs  

## Why Process Mining ? <br>
* identifying hidden nodes and bottlenecks in business processes.
